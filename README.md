# DAAE_Score
Development &amp; Validation of the DAAE Risk Score

This work supported by the European Consortium for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis. 

The DAAE Score was developed for estimating risk of conversion to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis over five years. It was developed for use in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients. 

The tool is publicly available at: https://tomfuchs.shinyapps.io/DAAE_Score_v1-2/

The code provided, written for R Notebooks, is meant as a public guideline for reproduction of the protocols used for the development of the DAAE Score. Risk calculators can have uses for a variety of outcomes, and the code provided could be adapted for use in a variety of clinical research applications.  

Risk estimates in the DAAE Score are based on combined data from the United States (Jacobs Multiple Sclerosis Center, n=1,309) and the Netherlands (Multiple Sclerosis Center Amsterdam, n=877). 
These estimates were generated using data from people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who were mostly female and mostly receiving low-efficacy disease modifying therapy. Risk is reported as a percent with 95% confidence intervals (CI)

The DAAE Score is named from the factors included in the predictive model: Disease Duration, Age at Disease Onset, Age, Expanded Disease Status Scale
